Info: What Minh Learned

Differences between input field and textarea
- input field has a value property; textarea don't
- textarea is like a <p></p> tag; input field ain't
- MangoMongoMomMongDB
- Postman
- Incorporating Express
- Mongo is the database lmao
- Postman is a program where you can make different types of requests to different urls. So if you have a proper path-matching system
and database input system set up, you can use Postman to SIMULATE requests
- Some Projects:
    - Simple Login
        - Takes input from form field, chucks it into Mongo after compiling and encrypting the stuffz
        - When u login, it checks if your thing is gucci and then creates a login token, throws that into the header (and Mong)
        - Shoots that thingy with login token into cookies (yum)
    - Password Generator API fetching
        - HS, fetches from front to back back to front
        - Back end can generate random passwords, throw to front
- Project organization and flow is a big part
    - Horizontal Scaling
    - Vertical Scaling
